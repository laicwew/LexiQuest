Dear {username},

I, {alienName}, want to express my heartfelt gratitude for all the help you've given me during these days. Thanks to your patience and guidance, I have now fully understood {country} and its language.

The words you taught me: {words}

have become the bridge between our worlds. Through them, I've learned not just vocabulary, but also the beauty of human culture and kindness.

If I ever have the chance to meet other beings from my planet, I hope you would be as generous in helping them as you have been with me.

Your friendship means the universe to me.

With warm regards,
